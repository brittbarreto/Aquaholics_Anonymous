    Streamflow Daily by Watershed
    Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest: Daily Streamflow by Watershed, 1956 - present

  Streamflow at 9 watersheds within the Hubbard Brook Experimental
  Forest has been measured continuously from as early as 1955. Streams
  are gaged with V-notch weirs at the outlet of each watershed. Height
  of water behind the weir increases with increased streamflow and is
  recorded by means of a float attached mechanically to a pen on a
  spring-wound strip-chart recorder. Gage height is converted to
  streamflow rate by calibration factors and then integrated to generate
  daily streamflow. Streamflow rate is measured as volume per unit
  time(L/s) and is proportional to the watershed area.

      
  Beginning January 1, 2013, instantaneous streamflow data (and derived
  daily streamflow) are measured by electronic sensors, and data are
  provisional as the transition from chart to digital data collection is
  still under evaluation. Data may be updated before they are finalized.
  Please contact the dataset creator prior to data use/publication.
  Daily streamflow data are derived from the instantaneous streamflow
  record, and additional information (quality control flagging and
  gapfilling) can be found in that record
  https://portal.lternet.edu/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-hbr&identifier=1

      
  In 2016, a new, more comprehensive gapfilling method was used, wherein
  data removed by QC flagging are calculated with a regression ensemble,
  using data from all remaining weirs that have data passing QC tests.
  The median of the predicted 5-minute discharge rates based on
  regression with the remaining weirs was used as the robust prediction
  of discharge for a data gap. Additionally, the difference between the
  prediction and the actual values at the beginning and end of a gap
  were set to zero to “snap” the prediction to the adjacent measured
  values.

      
  These data were gathered as part of the Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study
  (HBES). The HBES is a collaborative effort at the Hubbard Brook
  Experimental Forest, which is operated and maintained by the USDA
  Forest Service, Northern Research Station.

            CALCULATIONS
            
    HBEF daily stream flow for each of the nine gaged water sheds is
    published in units of mm/day. This measurement is a depth (mm) of
    water over the entire watershed. Conversion factors and the formulas
    for converting from ft3/sec to mm/day and from mm/day to ft3/sec are
    provided.
