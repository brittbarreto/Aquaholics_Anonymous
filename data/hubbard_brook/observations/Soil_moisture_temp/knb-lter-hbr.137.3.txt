Dataset Abstract

	Soil temperature and soil moisture have been measured
      at multiple locations at the Hubbard Brook Experimental
      Forest (HBEF), as part of a study of the relationships
      between snow depth, soil freezing and nutrient cycling
      (http://www.ecostudies.org/people_sci_groffman_snow_summary.html).Â 
      In October 2010, we established 6, 20 x 20-m plots (intensive
      plots) and 14 10 x 10-m plots (extensive plots) along an
      elevation gradient, with eight of the plots on north-facing
      slopes and twelve on south-facing slopes. Soil temperature
      and soil moisture were measured at hourly intervals on these
      plots beginning in November 2010. Six locations were
      discontinued in September 2012 (E04, E05, E06, E11-B, E13,
      and E14).
	These data were gathered as part of the Hubbard Brook
      Ecosystem Study (HBES). The HBES is a collaborative effort at
      the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, which is operated and
      maintained by the USDA Forest Service, Northern Research
      Station.
