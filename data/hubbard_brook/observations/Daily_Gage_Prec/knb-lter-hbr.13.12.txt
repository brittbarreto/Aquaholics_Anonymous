  Precipitation has been measured using rain gauges located in or around
  each watershed since 1956. Three types of rain gauges have been used:
  standard, mechanical weight recording, and electronic weight
  recording. Between 1956 and 2014, precipitation was measured weekly at
  standard gages located at 24 stations in or near gaged watersheds and
  at the headquarters building. Weight-recording gages were located at 7
  of the 24 stations and capture a continuous strip-chart record. Weekly
  totals were prorated using daily totals from the nearest recording
  gage. Beginning in 2011, electronic weighing rain gauges began being
  implemented to measure 15-minute precipitation. The number of
  precipitation stations was reduced to 10, when each station was fully
  converted to an electronic gauge for measuring 15-minute and daily
  precipitation beginning in 2015 (Green et al. 2018).

      
  These data were gathered as part of the Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study
  (HBES). The HBES is a collaborative effort at the Hubbard Brook
  Experimental Forest, which is operated and maintained by the USDA
  Forest Service, Northern Research Station.

  SAMPLING DESIGN

          
  Between 1956 and 2014, precipitation was measured at Hubbard Brook by
  a network of 7 weighing recording rain gages (RRG) and 24 standard
  rain gauges (SRG). During winter months (Nov-Mar) all gauges were
  charged with antifreeze and operated with funnels removed. All rain
  gauges were in clearings maintained to uniform standards with all
  trees beyond a 40-degree angle measured from the base of the rain
  gauge removed. Each rain gauge was equipped with Altar windshields to
  reduce wind effects. Rain gauges were mounted on stands at least 4
  feet above the ground to avoid being buried by snow in the winter.

          
  The analog charts on the recording rain gauges were changed
  approximately weekly, at which time the accumulation in the standard
  gages was measured. The daily recording rain gage data and weekly
  standard rain gage data were entered into the computer. Missing data
  were filled by estimation from other nearby gages. A computer program
  used the recording rain gage data to prorate the standard rain gage
  data into daily amounts. The final standard rain gage data are
  reported here.

          
  Beginning in 2011, electronic weighing rain gauges began being phased
  into operations for measuring 15-minute precipitation. In 2015, daily
  precipitation was summed at only 10 sites, which were instrumented
  with electronic gauges. All other sites were discontinued.

  calculate daily precipitation values. Raw RRG data are not presented
  in this data set.

          
  RRG 1 – SRG 1, 2, 4, 7, 8
