The folder in your computer should be Aquaholics_Anonymous (without master)
Inside that, you should have readme file and the folders (Topmodel_with_physics, data, etc)
If you don't see the above, change (move, rename, etc.)

Know your username and password. If you dont remember the password go to github and change it.
Open a terminal (Anaconda Prompt works, Command Prompt, etc.)
Navigate to where the Aquaholics_Anonymous folder is (with cd etc)

Commands:
git pull     to get updated files from repo onto your pc
 BUT you must NOT have uncommited changes. Either commit changes or reset, then pull.

git status   	to know what you have to do
		to know what is tracked and what is untracked

git add filename	add filename, which you modified, to the staging area
git add -a   		to add (all) new files to the staging area
git add foldername/	to add a specific folder/path (add the slash at the end to add the folder content)
(if you don't add a file, it will be untracked, git does not see it)
if you add (stage) a file by mistake, you can unstage with 	git reset HEAD

git rm filename		to remove filename from repo and from your computer
git rm --cached filename	to remove a file only from repo, NOT from your computer
git rm -r directory	to remove a folder (only difference with file is -r; you can use --cached -r)	


git commit -m "write your message here"   to commit (save) your changes in the staging area
git commit --amend - m "new message"	to overwrite the original message, if you have second thought
git commit 	without -m for message starts a text editor. Where you can write a longer than one-line message!
(Using text editor, like nano or vim, can be a nightmare. Please always add message with -m)

git push     to push the changes to the repo
 You cannot push to the remote if your local repo is not up to date with the remote. This is to avoid
 overwriting collaborators work

git checkout -- filename	undo changes to filename that are not staged yet (so not even added)
git reset HEAD filename		this is for unstaging filename after it was staged/added
(to do undo something already staged, first unstage with reset, then undo with checkout)\
git checkout hash3 filename	restore filename to previous version with hash hash3
(btw, this restoring to a previous version becomes a new version, does not delete all the versions after that)
git reset HEAD directory	to unstage all changes to files in directory
git reset HEAD	 or 	git reset	to unstage everything currently staged
git checkout -- directory	to undo all changes to files in directory
git checkout -- .		to undo all changes to files in current directory
git reset --hard HEAD^   to undo the last commit

git diff	shows all the changes in the repository (line by line of each file!)
git diff filename	shows difference between current and last saved version of filename
git diff directory	shows difference in the files of directory
git diff -r HEAD	compare current version of files (added? or before adding?) to most recent commit
git diff hash1..hash2	shows difference between two versions of a file (hash is unique ID of a file version)
git diff HEAD~1..HEAD~3	shows difference (in repo) between one commit ago and three commits ago 

git log		to see all commits, starting from the most recent
(press barspace to see older history; press q to exit the log)
git log filename	to see all committed changes of filename
git log directory	to see added and removed files in directory
git log -4 filename	to see the last 4 commits of filename

git show hash	use first few characters of a commit's hash to view commit's details
git show HEAD	shows details of last commit
git show HEAD~1	shows details of second-to-last commit
git show HEAD~2	shows details of third-to-last commit

git annotate filename	shows the history of changes of a file, who modified what and when in that file

git clean -n	lists untracked files, means there is no history of them (never committed)
git clean -f	deletes the untracked files. Warning! You don't want to delete something useful but untracked 
(or not tracked yet)

git config --list --local	shows settings for the project/repo
git config --list --global	shows settings common to all your projects/repos
git config --list --system	shows settings common to all users of the computer
git config --global user.name yourname	to set up your name, which is associated to your commits for every project
git config --local email.name yourname@aquaholics.com	to set up associated email to this specific project
(for other projects you prefer to use a different email address)

In the .gitignore file, in the repo main folder, you can put the files you want Git to ignore
test.py	would ignore test.py file
*.pdf	would ignore all pdfs
backup	would ignore the directory backup and all the files in it


git branch	list all branches in the repository, current marked with *
git diff branch1..branch2	shows difference between two branches of the repo
git checkout branch1	to switch to branch1
git checkout -b newbranch	creates newbranch, a copy of current branch (e.g. master), and switches to newbranch
git merge sourcebranch destinationbranch	to merge 2 branches
 What is new in source is transferred to destination
 Same (corresponding) line modified in both branches since branching is a conflict, you have to fix to merge
git status	to see files where there are conflicts (marked as  both modified:)
nano filename	to manually fix each of the above files (delete all the <<<, the >>> and the === lines,
 and keep one of the two versions of the line, this should solve the conflicts)\



git init project-name	to create a repository named project-name
(remember: DO NOT EVER create a repository inside another repository!)
git init	to turn the current directory into a repository
(because you may start working in your computer and then would like to turn your work up to then into a repo)
(however, the files in the current directory have all to be added to the repository!)

git remote -v	lists remotes (e.g. URL of the repo)
git remote add remotename URL/path	to add URL or path as a remote to current repo, with the name remotename
git remote rm remotename	to remove remotename from list of remotes
(remember that usually you only have one remote in github, so no need to worry about multiple remotes)
git pull remotename branchname	to pull from branchname in the remotename
git push remotename branchname	to push to branchname in the remotename
